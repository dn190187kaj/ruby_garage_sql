Given tables:

★ tasks (id, name, status, project_id)

★ projects (id, name)

Write the queries for:

1. get all statuses, not repeating, alphabetically ordered

select distinct(status)
from tasks
order by status

2. get the count of all tasks in each project, order by tasks count descending

select	t1.id,
	  t1.name,
	  count(t2.id) as 'COUNT'
from projects	as t1
left join tasks	as t2 on t1.id = t2.project_id
group by t1.id,
	   t1.name
order by COUNT DESC

3. get the count of all tasks in each project, order by projects names

select	t1.id,
	  t1.name,
	  count(t2.id) as 'COUNT'
from projects	as t1
left join tasks	as t2 on t1.id = t2.project_id
group by t1.id,
	   t1.name
order by t1.name

4. get the tasks for all projects having the name beginning with “N” letter

select t1.name,
	   t2.*
from projects	as t1
left join tasks	as t2 on t1.id = t2.project_id
					  and t1.name LIKE 'N%'


5. get the list of all projects containing the ‘a’ letter in the middle of the name, and

show the tasks count near each project. Mention that there can exist projects without

tasks and tasks with project_id=NULL

select	t1.id,
	  t1.name,
	  count(t2.id) as 'COUNT'
from projects	as t1
full join tasks	as t2 on t1.id = t2.project_id
					 and t1.name LIKE '%a%'
group by t1.id,
	   t1.name

6. get the list of tasks with duplicate names. Order alphabetically

select names
from tasks
group by names
having count(names) > 1

7. get the list of tasks having several exact matches of both name and status, from

the project ‘Garage’. Order by matches count

select name,
	  status,
	  count(*) as "COUNT"
from tasks
where project_id in (
					select project_id
					form project
					where name = 'Garage'
					)
group by name,
	   status
having count(*) > 1
order by COUNT

8. get the list of project names having more than 10 tasks in status ‘completed’. Order

by project_id

select t1.project_id,
	   t1.name
from projects	as t1
left join tasks	as t2 on t1.id = t2.project_id
					 and t2.status = 'completed'
group by t1.name
having count(t1.name) > 10
order by t1.project_id
